# 🧠 SQL Problem Solving – LeetCode & HackerRank

Welcome to my SQL problem-solving repository! This space showcases solutions to SQL questions that I’ve tackled **on both HackerRank and LeetCode**. The aim is to strengthen my SQL skills through practical challenges, and to share clean, optimized solutions with others who are learning too.
